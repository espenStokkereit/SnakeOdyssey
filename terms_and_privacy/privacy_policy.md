## Definition of Terms

In this notice, by “we” is meant the sole proprietorship Stokkereit Technologies, who built the “Snake Odyssey!” application. The “Application” represents the application “Snake Odyssey!”, and the “Service” refers to the Game as well as related websites and services we control.

In this text, “the user” means you as an individual who uses the Service. The term “data” is used to refer to personal data that can be related to the user.

The term “Service providers” means third party services and properties that might be utilized by the Service, including sharing of data. This notice will not apply to Service providers. Instead, we provide an overview of which Service providers are used and in which context, and refer links to relevant third party policies.

This notice applies to the Service. If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of data in relation to this policy. The data that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share data with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

We also recommend the user to read our [Terms of Service](terms_and_conditions.md), which explains the use of our Service.

## Data Collection

When using the Application, data will be collected according to the following categories.

- Application progress data: this is data related to the progress of the user within the Application, such as how many games have been unlocked, which games are marked as favorites, game scores and amount of in-game currency. Such data is stored only locally on the device running the Application, and we cannot access that data. When the Application is deleted on the device, all that data is also deleted.
- Application purchase data: this is data related to purchases done within the Application. In such scenarios we receive data from Service providers handling the purchases to validate the payments (however, we do not receive any payment method information).
- Device data: this is data about hardware or operating system based identifiers, and online identifiers such as IP address. This also includes device specific data such as language and coarse location.
- Service contact data: this is data related to the user having communication with us through the Service. This can for instance be email correspondence to provide customer service.

As we operate the Service globally, the data is likely to be stored and processed in other countries than the user’s home country when interacting with the Service. By using our Service, you consent to this practice.

## Data Use

The data we collect is only in order to provide a better user experience for the Application, and for monetization purposes. Here follows an overview of how data is used.

- Application progress data is stored in order for the user to be able to retain relevant data for the Application to function.
- Application purchase data is used in order for us to know which products have been purchased.
- Device data is solely used within the Application. No such data is stored by us.
- Service contact data is used for us to communicate with the user and keep track of communication history. This data will only be used for us to improve the Service.

## Data Collection Sources

- Application progress data is only collected when the user interacts with the Application. This data is only stored locally on the device that runs the Application.
- Purchase data is collected through purchases the user performs within the Application, and is handled through either Google Play or Apple’s App Store, depending on the operating system of the device. When such purchases have been performed, relevant data will also be stored as application progress data
- Device data is collected within the Application for it to provide the appropriate service (such as localization in relation to purchases).
- Service contact data is only collected in relation to the user choosing to communicate with channels of the Service, such as email correspondence for customer service.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device’s internal memory.

The Service does not use cookies explicitly. However, the Service may use third-party code and libraries that use cookies to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of the Service.

## Service Providers

As described in the previous sections, we may employ Service providers due to the following reasons:
- Facilitate the Service.
- Perform services related to the Service.
- Assist on analyzing how our Service is used by the users.

These Service providers may collect or have access to data related to the user. Remember that this notice does not apply to Service providers. We therefore provide a list of the relevant Service providers that might be used within the Application, as well as links to their external privacy policy.
- Google Play Services
- App Store

If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Data Retention Time

We will keep the data as long as necessary in order to achieve the purposes it was collected for. This includes providing the Service to the user, and to comply with relevant legal or reporting requirements.

## Data Security

We value your trust in providing us your data, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. We specifically chose to use established Service providers for storing your data to ensure compliance with industry standards for data security.
However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is perfectly secure and reliable. We therefore cannot guarantee the absolute security of the data.
